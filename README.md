# About
In Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI), we often rely on computational tools to process the raw images we get from a scanner into data that answers our research question. Compiled here are scripts in MATLAB, bash, and Python scripts, which one can use in order to perform fixel based analysis. In particular, this is useful in investigating the effects of aging on white matter microstructure in the human brain.

# Requirements
Make sure to have the Mrtrix3 package, as well as ANTS and FSL installed.
